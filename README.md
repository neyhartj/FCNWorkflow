# FCNWorkflow

A version of the [FCNWorkflow](https://github.com/daripp/XCT_FCN) created by [Devin Rippner](https://github.com/daripp) 
but modified to run on USDA's [SCINet Scientific Computing](https://scinet.usda.gov/) resource.

This repository provides template scripts for fitting a fully convolutional 
neural network for image semantic segmentation.

## Navigation

Versions of the workflow that work on SCINet can be found in the `scinet` repository.
